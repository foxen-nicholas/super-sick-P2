# Hello and welcome to my super-sick-P2 recipes finder!!!

*** Inspiration for the app ***

I have always had a passion for cooking and love trying new recipes.
I started baking with my mother at a young age and watched ALton Brown's "Good Eats" almost religiously.
So, I thought building an app like this would be awesome to have and make my own recipe finder!

*** How it went ***

Wow.... This was fun... If you want to call it that. Haha. Seriously though, I had a great time building this app.
I feel I learned sooo much just because of all the bugs I ran into and because of this I definitely have a better grasped of everything we have learned so far.
I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS as my stack to build the app with many depencies. Talking about dependencies, how great 
when a middleware has a new BREAKING version of software and nothing works like it should? This, too, was a great learning point.

The most difficult part for me was just getting everythin at it's proper version and having it work properly. Once this happened, I felt it was pretty smooth sailing.
I actually had a lot of fun buidling the different pages and can't wait to make everything look gorgeous!! 
Next step is CSS and then I want to look into adding another API.

*** Instructions on how to navigate ***
1. Register or Login to the app and you will be redirected to a categories page on successful log in.
2. Upon reaching this page, choose a category to look at recipes within that category
3. When you find a recipe you would like to view, click on the thumbnail.
4. At the recipe show page, you will have an option to add the recipe to your list of favorites to try.
5. There is a navigation bar located at the top. Just click on any of them to go to said page.

*** Stretch goals ***
1. Make it much prettier.
2. Add more functionality and videos for cooking the recipes
3. Maybe add another API to have a larger database
